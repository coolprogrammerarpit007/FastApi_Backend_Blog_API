DBMS :- DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
RDBMS :- RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

FOREIGN KEY:- HELPS YOU CONNECT DATA ACROSS TABLES, ENSURING THAT RECORDS IN ONE TABLE CAN REFERENCE RELATED INFORMATION IN ANOTHER


CONSTRAINTS AND THEIR TYPES

CONSTRAINTS:- RULES YOU SETUP TO STORE DATA INTO TABLE

TYPES OF CONSTRAINTS

1. NOT NULL
2. UNIQUE
3.PRIMARY KEY
4. FOREIGN KEY
5. CHECK
6. DEFAULT


DDL AND DML COMMANDS
DDL(DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE) -> DEFINE STRUCTURE OF DB -> LIKE -> CREATING/ALTERING/DELETING
DML(DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE)->LIKE -> INSERTING,UPDATING -> DML DEALS WITH ACTUAL DATA

// DELETE , DROP AND TRUNCATE COMMANDS
DROP AND TRUNCATE -> DOES NOT ALLOW ROLLBACK


GROUP BY AND ORDER BY CLAUSE


// GROUP BY
SELECT AVG(SALARY),DEPARTMENT
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;

// ORDER BY
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES
ORDER BY SALARY DESC;

// DIFF B/W WHERE AND HAVING

SELECT S_NAME,AGE FROM STUDENT
WHERE AGE >= 18;

SELECT AGE, COUNT(ROLL_NO)
FROM STUDENTS
GROUP BY AGE
HAVING COUNT(ROLL_NO) > 1;


// AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

1. COUNT()
2. SUM()
3. AVG().
4. MAX()
5. MIN()


INDEXING AND CLUSTER INDEX IN SQL

INDEXING-> IT'S LIKE GIVING  LABEL/PAGE NO TO THE DATABASE TO FIND DATA QUICKLY
CLUSTER INDEXING-> IT'S MEANS GIVING A RANGE OF DATABASE IDS SO TO FIND DATA MORE QUICKLY


NORMALIZATION:-

NORMALIZATION IN DATABASE WORKS BY ORGANIZING DATA EFFICIENTLY, MINIMIZING REDUNDANCY (DUPLICATE INFORMATION ) AND PREVENTING ISSUES WHEN INSERTING,UPDATING OR DELETING RECORDS


TYPES OF NORMALIZATIONS

1. FIRST NORMAL FORM(1NF):- EACH TABLE CELL SHOULD CONTAIN A SINGLE VALUE AND EACH COLUMN SHOULD HAVE A UNIQUE NAME
2. SECOND NORMAL FORM(2NF):- ALL NON-KEY ATTRIBUTE MUST DEPEND ON PRIMARY KEY
3. THIRD NORMAL FORM(3NF):- NO DATA IN TABLE SHOULD RELY ON OTHER DATA ON TABLE

4. BOYCE-CODD-NORMAL-FORM:- AN ATTRIBUTE THAT CAN DETERMINE OTHER ATTRIBUTE MUST BE CANDIDATE KEY


UNION AND NON UNION:-

UNION COMBINES BOTH LISTS WHILE PREVENTING DUPLICATES

SELECT FRIENDS FROM SCHOOLFRIENDS
UNION
SELECT FRIENDS FROM COLLEGEFRIENDS;

UNION ALL -> ALLOWS DUPLICATES


SECOND HIGHEST SALARY

SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY < (SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES);

// FIRST INNER MOST QUERY THEN OUTER QUERY WORKS


// VIEWS IN SQL

CREATE VIEWS

CREATE VIEW detailview AS
SELECT studentdetail
FROM studentdetails
WHERE sid < 5;
select * FROM detailview;

convert str to DATe format

CONVERT STR_TO_DATE('27-10-2024','%d-%m-%Y')

triggers in SQL

TRIGGERS LIKE AN REFLEX ACTION WHICH ALLOW YOU TO SETUP AUTOMATIC ACTION


QUERY

CREATE TRIGGER UpdateBookStock
AFTER INSERT ON BorrowBooks
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN UPDATE BOOKS SET available_count = available_count - 1
WHERE book_id = NEW.book_id;
